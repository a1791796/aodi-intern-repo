Reflection
1. I should use AI for assistance when I don't have ideas on my mind, it can trigger my thinking. 
After AI helping me to start the work, I should rely on my own knowledge to contine doing the work.

2. To avoid over-reliance on AI, I always tell myself donot get thing from AI without thinking. If I only copy and paste from AI,
AI is damaging me and I will be the one be replaced by AI.

3. While using AI, don't input the private data directly. I should tell AI the structure and the content of the data, and then get advice from it.

Task
1. One task AI can help me out is to modify the result I wrote. I need to show the result to others, so I need the result to be clear and concise. 
I don't know how to improve myself in this area but I can learn from the modified version. 

2. Yes, it require editing or face-checking everytime. AI generated contents are too much and not every point is needed for my tasks,
so normally I will read through all the content and find the useful informaton.

3. I will use AI to polish my analyse result to make it more sense to people.

Kanban help manage priority by listing the backlogs and the progress of workflow, everyone in the team can update the information by looking at the Kanban board. To avoid overload,
There is a WIP limits in the Kanban board which limits the maximum number of cards(items) in each column. 

To improve my workflow with Kanban, I should keep my working statues up-to-date in the Kanban. For example, like categorizing my work's priority and put it at the appropriate column, 
and post my questions and blockers on board.  Most importantly, move my "items" to next step once it has been solven.

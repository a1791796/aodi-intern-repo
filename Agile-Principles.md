The biggest benefit: Agile is very flexible to the changing of enviroment and customers' requirements, especially facing the uncertainty.
The biggest challenge: more time and energy from each one from the team because developers need to response to the customer's feedback as soon as possible and when there are too many
requirements from customers, developers easily get confused. 

How Agile improve my role and responsibility 
Better collaboration: Agile emphasis working closely with other roles, which creates good communication between us and leading better outcomes.
Continuous analysis: iterative works in Agile helps me identify issues quicker and easier.

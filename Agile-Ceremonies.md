How Agile Ceremonies helps:

Daily stand-ups: quick meeting/discussion everyday to review progress and blockers.

Sprint Planning: break the goals into short-time sprint and iterate the sprints. 

Continuous Prioritization: a way to give participants a view of progress and process in kanban board.

Retrospectives: look back the working from the last stage. 

Backlog Refinement: review the backlog and ensure the appropiate items are done.

I am in the data analystics role and my priority is to show my result to other people, the whole analysing process is not important to other because they might not know the method. So the continuous prioritization is the most important, this is where I put my research result and explain what is behind them.

adjust communication sytle:
Be more clear and direct. 
Be patient.

Some common UX like overcomplicate UI, overwhelming information, unappropriate UI design(color and features).

one practical change I can do this be patient and considerable during my work to support the vulnerable populations.

Some neurodivergent users may be sensitive to bright lights, loud sounds, or certain visual patterns. So allowing users to adjust the brightness or scheme color of the UI could be a solution.


Response:
I totally understand how overwhelming it can feel when you’re trying to stay on track, but things just don’t seem to come together. 
It’s really common to experience this, especially when executive functioning is a challenge,so I want to let you know that you’re not alone in this.
Here are a few ideas that might help you gain a bit more control over your tasks: break it into small tasks, use a timer in tasks and ask for help anytime you need.
I know it might feel tough right now, but with small changes and patience, you’ll start to feel more in control.

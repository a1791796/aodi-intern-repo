My Role: I am working as a data analytics. The days and times I work are Friday, Wednesday/Thursday and a little bit on weekends.

How I Wrok Best: when I have a clear understanding of goal, when I had a good rest.
Struggle: when don't know how to start the work, when the work is repeated and boring.

Communication style:
I prefer messages and emails to be short and clear.
The best way to reach me is discord then email.

Collaboration and Teamwork:
I work best in the team when everyone is nice and balance workload.
My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is people don't response to when they suppose to and I doing too much work or not feeling contribuing to the team.
if I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I am empty in my brain or thinking how to response(translating languages in my mind) 

Focus and productivity 
I stay focused by listening to music while working/studying. Thing that distact me is the sound and people walking around, so I listen to music to keep me away from outside sound.
The best way to support my productivity is to tell me what I need to do clearly.

Feedback and Growth
I like feedback to be private and direct, better with the exmaples to help me improve on it.
When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is letting me know privately.
I appreciate it when teammates help me when I am in trouble, come up with new idea.

Fun facts and Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is I am unhappy or angry, but I just have no facial expression when I feel peace.
A fun fact about me is I love spicy food.
My work superpower is finish a working with my skills, a sense of achievement.

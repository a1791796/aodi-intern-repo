My role is data/business analytics, so I will work with the developers team. I think my role is to analyze the developers work on products and show the results to the skateholders and
project manager because they don't know much about the coding stuff. What I need to do is to transfer the code to human-readable graphs and words for the skateholders.
I think BA's role is to connect the developers to the user/skateholders, to help exchanging their ideas.

One role I will work frequently with is the developers team. For example, I can conduct a analysis about the user experience on the app and show the result to developers,
then might suggest how to improve the user experience.

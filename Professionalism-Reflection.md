I have experienced good teamwork in a Uni project. We met once a week duing the course and other communication mainly through discord. 
All people respect each other and listen to everyone's idea. In the great teamwork and professionalism team, good communication and repsect among the 
teammates make the whole team effective.

Be clear and with respectful language when talking. Be considerable and patient when listening.

To help with the professional environment, be professional person in the team first.  encourage and support others in the team.
